# PI_by_MonteCarlo
Estimation of value of 'pi' constant by using Monte Carlo method ( i.e. random probability technique).

This estimation is not with large accuracy. 
It only gives the idea about 'How to implement Monte Carlo method?'
The program simply draws a square on screen with a circle centered at center of square and touching the sides of square.
Then randomly draws dots in the square.
Obviously the ratio of number of dots inside circle to total number of dots is directly proportional to the ratio of area of circle to that of square.
Thus, finally with little maths we get estimated value of pi.
